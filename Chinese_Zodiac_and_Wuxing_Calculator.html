		<h2>Chinese Zodiac</h2>
		<p>The Chinese zodiac is the classification scheme that assigns an
			animal to each year in a repeating twelve-year cycle. The 12-year
			cycle of Chinese zodiac is an approximation to the 11.86-year cycle
			of Jupiter, the largest planet of the solar system.It is a scheme and
			systematic plan of future action that relates each year to an animal
			and its reputed attributes according to a 12-year cycle. It remains
			popular in several East Asiancountries including China, Vietnam,
			Korea, Japan, Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			The 12 Chinese Zodiac animals are in a fixed order according to
			Chinese Yin and Yang Theory and perceived attributes. The yin or the
			yang of the animals is defined based on the odd or even number of
			their claws (or toes, hoofs). The animals are then arranged in an
			alternating yin-yang sequence. Usually an animal has is the same
			number of claws on its front and rear legs. However the rat has four
			toes on its fore legs and five on its hind legs. As the old saying
			goes, “a thing is valued in proportion to its rarity”, so the Rat
			ranks first of the 12 zodiac animals. It uniquely combines the
			attributes of odd (yang) and even (yin). 4+5=9, and yang is dominant,
			so the Rat is classified as odd (yang) overall.<span

		<h2>Wuxing</h2>
		<p>
			Whereas Western thought developed the idea of elements as subtsances,
			and Indian thought as emenations, Chinese philosophy conceived of the
			five elements, or Wu Xing, as dynamic states of change. The concept
			of Wu Xing is central to all elements of Chinese thought, including
			science, philosophy, medicine, astrology, andFengshui. The Wu Xing,
			also known as the Five Elements, Five Phases, the Five Agents, the
			Five Movements, Five Processes, the Five Steps/Stages and the Five
			Planets is the short form of "Wǔ zhǒng liúxíng zhī qì" or "the five
			types of chi dominating at different times".<span
				data-showtip="M.Alan Kazlev, 'Wu Xing the Five States of Change', page 16, July 1999 ">[2]</span>
			It is a fivefold conceptual scheme that many traditional Chinese
			fields used to explain a wide array of phenomena, from cosmic cycles
			to the interaction between internal organs, and from the succession
			of political regimes to the properties of medicinal drugs. The "Five
			Phases" are Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. This order of
			presentation is known as the "mutual generation" sequence. In the
			order of "mutual overcoming", they are Wood, Earth, Water, Fire, and
			Metal.<span
